    - Wai! *waves* Hey you there!
    - You look like there's someone in your life that needs taking down a peg or
      two.
    - Why don't you pull up a chair, and tell Granny who's been grinding your gears
      lately?
  - name: PreNameWriting
    dialogueLines:
    - Don't worry, Granny's got you!
    - I've got just the right kind of shoe to smite them with, too!
  - name: PreSmiting

    - 'Why don''t you have a go too? It''ll be quicker and more effective with the
      both of us going at it! '
  - name: PostSmiting
    dialogueLines:
    - Brilliant! That should do it!
    - Say, you seem like a dab hand at this!
    - " I\u2019ve actually been looking for an apprentice to take over when I retire. "
    - 'This spot under the bridge is a good one and it would be a shame if nobody
      were here to take care of things when I retire. '
    - Are you at all interested in learning from old Granny?
    - "Each week we\u2019ll progress your apprenticeship by meeting clients who come
      to you with the names and deeds of their petty enemies. I\u2019ll stand by
      and coach you until I feel you are ready to take over from me. How about it?"
